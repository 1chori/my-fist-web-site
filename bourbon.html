    <h2>Bourbon Whisky</h2>
    <p>
        Bourbon is a type of barrel-aged American whiskey made primarily from corn.
        The name derives from the French Bourbon dynasty, although the precise
        source of inspiration is uncertain; contenders include Bourbon County
        in Kentucky and Bourbon Street in New Orleans, both of which are named
        after the dynasty. The name bourbon was not applied until the 1850s,
        and the Kentucky etymology was not advanced until the 1870s.
