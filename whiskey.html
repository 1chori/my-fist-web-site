    fermented grain mash. Various grains (which may be malted) 
    are used for different varieties, including barley, corn, rye, and wheat. 
    Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks, which are typically
    made of charred white oak. Uncharred white oak casks previously 
    used for the aging of sherry are also sometimes used.</p>
