    <h2>Bourbon Whisky</h2>
    <p>A blended whiskey (or blended whisky) is the product of blending
        different types of whiskeys and sometimes also neutral grain spirits,
        colorings, and flavorings. It is generally the product of mixing one
        or more higher-quality straight or single malt whiskey with less expensive spirits
        and other ingredients. This typically allows for a lower priced finished product,
        although expensive "premium" varieties also exist.</p>
