    <h2>Singlemalt Whisky</h2>
    <p>Single malts are typically associated with single malt Scotch,
        though they are also produced in various other countries.
        Under the United Kingdom's Scotch Whisky Regulations,
        a "Single Malt Scotch Whisky" must be made exclusively from
        malted barley (although the addition of E150A caramel colouring
        is allowed), must be distilled using pot stills at a single distillery,
        and must be aged for at least three years in oak casks of a capacity
        not exceeding 700 litres (150 imperial gallons; 180 US gallons).</p>
